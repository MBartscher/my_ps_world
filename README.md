# my_ps_world
My collection of ps-scripts (&amp; some batch, for the history) to manage backups, files and scripts.

During my time as a SPS-Programmer I produced this scripts to automate my management of backups, files and scripts. Maybe it can help as inspiration. :)

...Alright...
I realized, I started to do this Jobs with batch. Later I used the (here presented) batch-files to call my functions. With them it's far more easier to create an executable icon on the desctop, than with ps-scripts...
